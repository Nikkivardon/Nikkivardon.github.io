This week my view of "doing history" work and research has changed quite a bit. The idea of 'open access' is not a notion that is often associated with history research. Rather, it is often characterized by digging deeply into primary sources, keeping many notes and taking lots of time, as [McDaniels](https://via.hypothes.is/http://wcm1.web.rice.edu/open-notebook-history.html#annotations:-QqELnt0Eem-PIvRWf_JdA) explains "professional historians, however, leave many of our notes sitting in dusty file folders, overstuffed hard drives, and stacked bankersâ€™ boxes." However, today more than ever, history is becoming defined by a different type of research and sources. The advent of blogs, interactive bibliographies, and more promise open access that brings benefits for intellectual community and exchange, error prevention, and a lasting wealth of accessible knowledge. 

This new view of research is a stark change from what I have learned as a history minor and student in general. Throughout my academic career, research has typically been framed as a individual endeavour only to be shared with the public upon completion. Pouring over books, news papers and online journals, my own experience with research has never been accompanied by my colleauges or acadmeic community. While professors encourage and help revise students work, the idea of "open access research" has been foreign to me until now. 

The presence of "open access research" Where are the dangers and where are the opportunities? What does 'open access' mean for you as a student?
