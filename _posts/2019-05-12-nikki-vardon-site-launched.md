Well. I've sort of figured it out. This week I signed up for each of the required programs/sites including Dh box, hypothesis, and github. Signing up for each account was fairly simple however using each tool seem daunting. However, I am looking forward to advancing my research and technology ability while connecting the "digital history" dots. 
  One of the most significant things I've accomplished this week is setting up a site to post my blogs each week. I was able to find some helpfu posts online to guide me through the process. Given this and the getting started portion of the course I am looking forward to the following weeks. 
The first few readings highlighted various insights for me. The Historian's Macroscope, by Graham et al, displays the growing need for historians to learn the "language" of the digital world. As an undergraduate student, just beginning to understand research and researching, developing this specific skill set had never crossed  my mind. The Guldi and Armitage reading explain the increase in big data as a call to look at the past and understand history in a "bigger" way by look at patterns rather than moments. 
Overall, this has been a successful week and I anticipate more learning and growing moving forward
